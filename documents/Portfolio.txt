I am a police corporal, my name is Michael Pudman, I count thirty-two years of active service in the Mauritius Police Force. During my posting to the Police IT Unit, in year 2014, I was selected to follow a course in Network Security at the UTL Technologies Ltd found in Bengaluru, Karnataka 560022, India; for a period of two and a half months.
During one of our study tours, we visited the state of Tamil Nadu also known as Chennai. We visited a few nature parks and several wonders such as a group of monuments at Mahabalipuram.
This group of sanctuaries, founded by the Pallava kings, was carved out of rock along the Coromandel coast in the 7th and 8th centuries.  In 1984 it adhered to the World Heritage List of the UNESCO.

Wonderful India!
